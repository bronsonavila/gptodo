### The Problem

I have a dry erase board on my refrigerator where I write down groceries to buy. When I go shopping, I take a photo of the board, but I can't mark items off in the photo. This makes it hard to track what I've already picked up.

### The Solution

GPToDo converts my shopping list photo into a checklist. I take a picture of my whiteboard, upload it, and check off items as I shop. Easy.
